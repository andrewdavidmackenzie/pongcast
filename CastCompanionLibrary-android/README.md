## Change List
1.12
### Notice: there are some backward-incompatible changes in this release, please read the change list carefully
 * Changing CCL to use Application Context in most everything. As a result, one does not need to set context for CCL in each
       Activity which should avoid any context leaks and prevent some random NPEs. Consequently, there will be no "dialog" supported by
       CCL unless the caller method provides an explicit context. For various versions of reconnectSessionIfPossible, we now have
       reconnection callbacks that can be used by callers to provide visual feedback, so these methods now have new signatures.
       In addition, now you can initialize Cast Managers in your Application's onCreate().
       There are some backward-incompatible changes so clients need to make adjustments if needed.
       In particular, the noteworthy breaking changes are:
     * Variations of reconnectSessionIfPossible have new arguments
     * Utils.showErrorDialog() has been removed
     * setContext() on Cast Managers is removed
     * CastManagers' getInstance(Context) are removed
 * Updating BaseCastManager, VideoCastManager and DataCastManager to use CopyOnWriteArraySet to manage consumers. Since the number of
 consumers is low, there will be no performance hit and CopyOnWriteArraySet provides a safer data structure.
 * Decoupled dependency between components interested in receiving notifications when the list of active tracks
   changes and the sources that can cause such changes. This also allowed improving the TracksChooserDialog
   to gracefully rebuild itself when needed.
 * Improving VideoCastControllerFragment's behavior when it needs to be closed.
 * Fixing an issue that upon reconstruction of VideoCastControllerActivity/Fragment, it would restart the media.
 * In VideoCastControllerFragment, moved most of the initial work to onActivityCreated() so that a rebuild of the associated activity and fragment doesn't run into a NPE
 * Adding a new API to allow clients set the MediaAuthService directly (VideoCastManager.setMediaAuthService(IMediaAuthService authService))
 * Making sure that the reconnection AsyncTask is using a thread pool regardless of the Android version,
 * Removed "Video Tracks" from Tracks Chooser Dialog since that doesn't make sense to be presented there.
 * Updating the style of Cast dialog for Lollipop to match the respective framework.
 * Adding Toolbar component to the simple cast_activity.xml layout in landscape, this was missed in a previous update where toolbar was introduced.
 * Changing the icon representing "Disconnect" in Lollipop notification
 * Fixing a bug where notification service wouldn't restart if playback was restarted on a different device.
 * Fixing an issue that when a new media was started while another one was casting, the metadata wouldn't update immediately
   in VideoCastControllerActivity to reflect the new media.
 * Updating to the latest version of Gradle suitable for the latest publicly released version of Android Studio,
 * Updating the gradle build to use the latest version of Google Play Services and selectively use cast APIs from Google Play Services.
 * Improving discovery for MediaRouteButton by resetting the count of discovered routes whenever cast discovery is stopped.
 * Updating the PDF documentation
